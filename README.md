# FaceTrack-Attendance-System
Its an Facial Base attendance System in which the attendance will be marked automatically (for testing purpose I have kept a condition that if 'p' is pressed then only attendance will be marked) and it is stored in the database (for Hackathon I have used SQL)

# 1) Add_Student.py 
This file will help to add the student to the database by capturing the face of the student using webcam.
